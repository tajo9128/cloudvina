BioDockify: Final Blueprint as a Pure In-Silico NAM Platform
Version: 1.0
Date: January 2, 2026
Status: Strategic Blueprint for Implementation

Executive Summary
BioDockify is a cloud-native In-Silico NAM (Non-Animal Methodology) platform that integrates mechanistic docking, molecular dynamics validation, AI-based toxicity prediction, and weight-of-evidence reporting to support early nonclinical decision-making without animal testing.
Core Promise: Reduce unnecessary animal experimentation through integrated computational evidence in early drug discovery.

1. What BioDockify IS (Clear Definition)
BioDockify is a cloud-based In-Silico NAM platform designed to support early nonclinical decision-making and lead prioritization using computational evidence-without animal experiments.
Scope
* Discovery Phase: Early compound screening → lead identification
* Timeline: Weeks to months (pre-IND decision support)
* Users: Biotech, CROs, academic translational labs, pharma R&D
Purpose
1. Reduce unnecessary animal testing by filtering out toxic/inactive compounds computationally
2. Prioritize lead compounds based on mechanistic + safety evidence
3. Support nonclinical decision-making with transparent, integrated evidence
Positioning
* Decision support tool (not regulatory replacement)
* Early-stage triage (not definitive safety assessment)
* Evidence aggregator (not single-method prediction)
* Screening enabler (not clinical predictor)

2. What BioDockify IS NOT (Critical Boundaries)
BioDockify Does NOT Claim:
* ❌ Replacement of all animal testing
* ❌ Regulatory approval or validation status
* ❌ OECD or FDA acceptance as definitive method
* ❌ Definitive safety conclusions
* ❌ Chronic toxicity prediction
* ❌ Reproductive toxicity assessment
* ❌ Clinical efficacy proof
* ❌ Manufacturing or formulation guidance
BioDockify Explicitly Supports (Honest Scope):
* ✅ Early-stage compound screening
* ✅ Mechanism-driven prioritization
* ✅ Weight-of-evidence reasoning
* ✅ Risk stratification (Low/Medium/High)
* ✅ Target-engagement prediction
* ✅ ADMET/toxicity risk flagging
* ✅ Decision-making transparency

3. Mandatory NAM Context of Use (Official Statement)
This statement MUST appear in:
* Platform documentation (FAQ, methods)
* Every NAM Evidence Report footer
* Website regulatory/legal page
* User onboarding materials
* Publication disclaimers
Official Context-of-Use Declaration:
"BioDockify provides an in-silico NAM workflow intended for early nonclinical screening and lead prioritization to support pharmacological decision-making and reduce unnecessary animal experimentation. The platform is NOT intended to replace definitive in vivo safety studies, regulatory testing, or clinical evaluation. Results should be interpreted within the context of the computational methods' known limitations and integrated with other evidence sources."
Why This Matters (Regulatory Trust)
* Establishes honest scope (not overstated)
* Identifies intended use (early screening, not safety conclusion)
* Declares non-replacement (preserves animal study necessity for regulated claims)
* Invites integration with other methods (Weight-of-Evidence appropriate)
* Builds regulatory goodwill (transparency = credibility)

NAM EVIDENCE REPORT (Decision Output)
Pipeline Design Principles
1. Reproducibility
* Every step uses fixed algorithms/versions
* Deterministic outputs (same input = same output)
* Seeds locked (no random parameter drift)
* Version documented: e.g., NAM Pipeline v1.0, Jan 2026
2. Versioning & Control
* Pipeline versioning (v1.0, v1.1, v2.0 with changelog)
* Model versioning (each QSAR/DL model has timestamp)
* Parameter locking (no ad-hoc adjustments)
* Traceability logs (which version generated this prediction?)
3. No Ad-Hoc Parameter Drift
* ❌ Don't change MD simulation time based on "intuition"
* ❌ Don't skip docking because one tool is "slow"
* ❌ Don't use different descriptor sets for different compounds
* ✅ Same parameters for all compounds (statistical validity)
4. Locked Workflow (Not User-Configurable)
* Standard pipeline for all users
* Optional: "custom pipeline" tier (enterprise only, with validation)
* Public tier: standardized NAM only
* Transparency: document why each step exists

5. Detailed Module Breakdown (NAM-Specific Design)
5.1 Input Standardization Module
Purpose: Prevent garbage-in/garbage-out NAM results
Workflow:
User Input (SMILES, SDF, or structure draw)
↓
Ligand Standardization
├─ Tautomer enumeration & removal
├─ Protonation at pH 7.4
├─ Salt stripping
├─ Chirality preservation
↓
Protein Preparation
├─ Add hydrogens
├─ Assign partial charges (AMBER/GAFF)
├─ Validate binding site
├─ Check for missing residues
↓
Descriptor Calculation (Basic)
├─ Molecular weight
├─ LogP / PSA / HBA/HBD
├─ Flexibility (rotatable bonds)
├─ Similarity to reference (optional)
↓
Input Validation & QC
├─ Check molecular weight range (80-800 Da)
├─ Flag Pan-Assay Interference compounds (PAINS)
├─ Check for known problematic scaffolds
├─ Validate protein structure integrity
↓
PASS ✅ (Proceed to Docking) OR FAIL ❌ (Report & Stop)
Key QC Flags:
* Molecular weight outside typical drug range
* Known PAINS structures detected
* High-spin metal centers (problematic for modeling)
* Protein chain breaks or missing residues
* Binding site partially obscured
Output:
* Standardized SMILES + 3D structure
* QC report (PASS/FAIL with reasoning)
* Basic physchem summary

5.2 Mechanistic NAM Module: Docking Consensus
Purpose: Mechanistic plausibility of target engagement (not absolute affinity ranking)
Workflow:
Standardized Ligand + Protein
↓
RUN AUTODOCK VINA
├─ 9 independent docking runs
├─ 20 poses per run (exhaustiveness = 8)
├─ Output: binding affinity (kcal/mol)
↓
RUN GNINA (Deep Learning Docking)
├─ CNN-based scoring (trained on PDBbind)
├─ 10 diverse poses
├─ Output: GNINA score
↓
POSE ALIGNMENT & AGREEMENT ANALYSIS
├─ Cluster all poses (RMSD < 2.5 Å)
├─ Find consensus binding mode
├─ Calculate inter-tool agreement
├─ Compute pose stability (cluster size)
↓
SCORE NORMALIZATION
├─ Vina scores → percentile rank (vs reference compounds)
├─ GNINA scores → percentile rank
├─ Combined consensus rank (average)
↓
OUTPUT: CONSENSUS DOCKING EVIDENCE
├─ Best binding pose (consensus geometry)
├─ Tool agreement score (0-100%)
├─ Binding confidence tier (Low/Medium/High)
├─ Alternative poses (if significant)
└─ Mechanism interpretation (pharmacophore annotations)
Consensus Scoring Logic:
Vina_percentile = rank of best Vina score / total Vina models
GNINA_percentile = GNINA score percentile
Consensus_score = (0.5 × Vina_percentile) + (0.5 × GNINA_percentile)
Agreement_metric = percentage of poses within 2.5 Å RMSD of top cluster
→ Low agreement: scattered poses → mechanistic uncertainty
→ High agreement: convergent poses → robust mechanism
Confidence_tier:
├─ HIGH: Consensus_score > 75% AND Agreement > 70%
├─ MEDIUM: Consensus_score 40-75% OR Agreement 40-70%
└─ LOW: Consensus_score < 40% OR Agreement < 40%
NAM Role & Interpretation:
* Shows plausibility of binding (does the molecule fit the pocket?)
* Does NOT predict affinity ranking (two compounds with same consensus ≠ same in vivo potency)
* Does NOT predict selectivity (use off-target predictions separately)
* Useful for mechanism validation (pharmacophore matching)
* Screening value: deprioritize compounds with no consensus docking
Output:
* PDB file (best consensus pose)
* Docking report (Vina + GNINA scores, agreement %)
* Mechanism figure (2D pharmacophore or 3D pose)

5.3 Dynamic NAM Module: Molecular Dynamics Validation
Purpose: Validate time-dependent stability of ligand-receptor complex (major NAM differentiator)
Workflow:
Docking Result (Best Consensus Pose)
↓
SYSTEM PREPARATION (OpenMM)
├─ Solvate complex (TIP3P water, 10 Å buffer)
├─ Add counter-ions (neutralize charge)
├─ Build topology (AMBER ff14SB for protein, GAFF2 for ligand)
↓
EQUILIBRATION (0.5 ns)
├─ Minimize energy (10,000 steps)
├─ Warm-up: NVT 50K → 300K (50 ps)
├─ Equilibrate: NPT 300K (450 ps)
↓
PRODUCTION MD (5-20 ns; configurable)
├─ NVT ensemble, 300K, 1 atm
├─ Timestep: 2 fs
├─ Sampling frequency: every 10 ps (500-2000 snapshots)
↓
STABILITY METRICS CALCULATION
├─ RMSD (Root Mean Square Deviation)
│ └─ Ligand RMSD vs initial docking pose
│ (Target: < 3 Å = stable; > 5 Å = unstable)
│
├─ RMSF (Root Mean Square Fluctuation)
│ └─ Per-residue flexibility
│ (Target: binding site residues < 2 Å = stable)
│
├─ Contact Persistence
│ └─ H-bonds, π-stacking, hydrophobic contacts
│ (Target: > 60% occupancy = robust)
│
├─ Ligand Escape Detection
│ └─ Distance from binding site centroid over time
│ (Target: remains within 5 Å = engagement maintained)
│
└─ Binding Free Energy (Optional, if MMPBSA available)
└─ ΔG estimate (rough estimate only)
↓
STABILITY CLASSIFICATION
├─ STABLE: RMSD < 3 Å, contacts maintained, no escape
├─ QUESTIONABLE: RMSD 3-5 Å OR contacts weakening
└─ UNSTABLE: RMSD > 5 Å OR ligand escapes OR no contacts
↓
OUTPUT: DYNAMIC STABILITY EVIDENCE
├─ RMSD trajectory plot
├─ Contact stability timeline
├─ MD simulation video (optional)
├─ Stability classification
└─ Confidence in mechanism (revised based on dynamics)
Interpretation Guidance:
* Stable complex: Binding is mechanistically plausible + time-stable
* Unstable complex: Initial docking misleading; compound likely inactive in vivo
* Borderline: Weak binding; may need chemical optimization
NAM Value:
* QSAR-only platforms can't detect transient binding (poor MD = false positive docking)
* MD simulation adds biological realism (not just static poses)
* Stability metrics provide confidence adjustment to docking scores
* Reduces false-positive actives significantly
Computational Cost:
* 5 ns: ~2-4 GPU hours (affordable on Google Colab)
* 10 ns: ~4-8 GPU hours
* 20 ns: ~8-16 GPU hours
* Strategy: 5 ns standard, 20 ns for critical candidates
Output:
* RMSD/RMSF trajectories (PNG plots)
* MD simulation report (text summary)
* Stability classification (STABLE/QUESTIONABLE/UNSTABLE)

↓
UNCERTAINTY QUANTIFICATION
├─ Model variance (std. dev. of ensemble)

├─ Endpoint predictions (class or continuous)
├─ Model agreement scores
├─ Uncertainty flags
├─ Risk ranking (Green / Yellow / Red)
└─ Mechanistic interpretation (if available)
Key Rules for NAM Reporting:
1. Show Agreement & Disagreement
o ✅ "3 of 4 models predict hERG inhibition (75% agreement)"
o ❌ Don't report single model score without context
2. Explicit Uncertainty Flags
o ✅ "Ames prediction is UNCERTAIN (models disagree)"
o ✅ "Molecule is OUTSIDE applicability domain (similar to <5% of training data)"
o ❌ Don't hide disagreement
3. Risk Stratification (Not Absolute)
o 🟢 GREEN (Low Risk): No red flags, all models agree safe
o 🟡 YELLOW (Medium Risk): Some flags or uncertainty
o 🔴 RED (High Risk): Multiple flags or consensus toxic prediction
Output:
* Endpoint report (table + interpretations)
* Risk matrix visualization
* Applicability domain plots
* Uncertainty quantification

6. Weight-of-Evidence (WoE) Engine (Core of NAM System)
Purpose: Convert individual tool outputs into an integrated decision support score

├─ Mutagenicity prediction (negative = high score)
├─ DILI risk (low = high score)
├─ BBB penetration & CNS exposure
├─ Model agreement across endpoints (high = high score)
└─ Interpretation: "What is the safety risk profile?"

7. Limitations & Uncertainty Declaration (Mandatory)
Every NAM output MUST include this section:
7.1 Known Limitations
Temporal Scope:
* ❌ Not valid for chronic toxicity (model trained on acute data)
* ❌ Not valid for reproductive toxicity (insufficient training data)
* ❌ Not valid for carcinogenicity (long-term mechanism not captured)
Mechanism Scope:
* ❌ Cannot predict off-target effects (only screens primary target)
* ❌ Cannot predict drug-drug interactions (metabolism complex)
* ❌ Cannot assess formulation or delivery barriers
Model Scope:
* ❌ Models valid only within applicability domain (chemical space boundaries)
* ❌ Poor performance on novel scaffolds outside training data
* ❌ Limited to small molecules (not suitable for biologics)
Population Scope:
* ❌ No species extrapolation (trained primarily on human data)
* ❌ No age/sex stratification (general population assumed)
* ❌ No genetic polymorphism assessment (metabolism variants not captured)
7.2 Uncertainty Declaration (Per Compound)
Example:
UNCERTAINTY ASSESSMENT FOR COMPOUND X:
1. Applicability Domain Status:
✅ Within AD (compound 87% similar to training compounds)
2. Model Agreement:
✅ HIGH (4/5 models agree on hERG prediction)
🟡 MEDIUM (2/3 models agree on DILI risk; threshold borderline)
3. Confidence Bands:
• hERG prediction: 95% confidence
• DILI risk: 65% confidence (lower due to disagreement)
• BBB permeability: 92% confidence
4. Mechanistic Uncertainty:
⚠️ MD stability borderline (RMSD 2.9 Å; threshold is 3.0 Å)
→ Recommend longer simulation if critical decision
5. Major Caveats:
❌ No evaluation of off-target hERG channel variants
❌ No assessment of metabolite toxicity
❌ Chronic toxicity not addressed
7.3 Transparency Statement (Boilerplate in Every Report)
"This NAM report is a computational screening tool intended to inform early-stage decision-making. The predictions are based on machine learning models trained on limited datasets and are subject to model uncertainty, applicability domain boundaries, and known mechanistic gaps. Results do NOT replace experimental validation, in vitro testing, or regulatory safety studies. Use this report in context with other evidence sources (literature, prior knowledge, experimental data). Do not rely on this tool as a standalone safety assessment."

15. Key Phrases for Regulatory Conversations
Use these when speaking to stakeholders, regulators, or partners:
1. "BioDockify is an early-stage screening tool, not a replacement for regulatory studies."
2. "We provide integrated evidence, not single-method predictions."
3. "Every output includes uncertainty quantification and applicability domain assessment."
4. "The platform is designed to reduce unnecessary animal testing, not eliminate regulatory requirements."
5. "Our transparency and documentation standards meet OECD guidelines for in-silico tools."

Conclusion
BioDockify, as a pure in-silico NAM platform, offers:
* Integrity: Honest scope, transparent limitations, genuine utility
* Innovation: Mechanistic + dynamic + predictive integration (rare combination)
* Impact: Early-stage screening reduces animal experiment waste
* Adoption: OECD-aligned, regulatory-friendly positioning
* Scalability: Cloud-native, SaaS model, global reach
The path forward is clear: build the platform with NAM principles, validate internally, communicate honestly about scope, and establish industry trust through transparency.
