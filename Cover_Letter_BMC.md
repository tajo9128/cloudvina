Dear Editor,

We are submitting our research article titled above for consideration in *BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology*.

As the prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) rises, there is an urgent need for multi-target therapeutic strategies. Our study addresses this by introducing a **computational framework for polypharmacology**, specifically targeting the synergistic inhibition of AChE, BACE1, and GSK-3β.

**Why this study fits BMC Pharmacology and Toxicology:**
Our work goes beyond simple prediction algorithms to focus on the **pharmacological relevance** of the identified candidates. By leveraging a high-fidelity dataset of 10,134 molecules and achieving **91.48% accuracy**, we provide a validated tool for identifying multi-target ligands (MTDLs) with potential disease-modifying effects.

Crucially, we incorporate **SHAP-based interpretability analysis** to identify pharmacophoric features (such as benzylpiperidine and indanone moieties) that drive high-affinity binding. This provides actionable insights for medicinal chemists designing the next generation of AD therapeutics. We further validate our model against known FDA-approved drugs (e.g., Donepezil, Rivastigmine) to demonstrate its clinical applicability.

We believe this integrated approach—combining state-of-the-art AI with rigorous pharmacological validation—will be of significant interest to your readers working at the interface of drug discovery and computational toxicology.

This manuscript is original, has not been published previously, and is not under consideration by another journal.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
