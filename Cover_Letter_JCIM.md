**Subject:** Submission of Manuscript: "Stacked Ensemble Deep Learning with Interpretability for Multi-Target Drug Discovery: A Generalizable Framework Applied to Alzheimer's Disease"

Dear Editor,

I am pleased to submit our original research article titled above for consideration in the *Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling*.

Alzheimer's disease drug discovery has long been hindered by the "one-target, one-drug" paradigm, which fails to address the multifactorial nature of the pathology. In this work, we present a **generalizable, interpretability-first deep learning framework** designed to simultaneously identify inhibitors for three critical targets: Acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Beta-secretase 1 (BACE1), and Glycogen Synthase Kinase 3 beta (GSK-3β).

**Key contributions of our work include:**
1.  **Superior Performance:** We developed a Stacked Generalization Ensemble integrating MolFormer-XL and ChemBERTa-77M, achieving **91.48% validation accuracy** and **0.929 AUC-ROC** on a rigorously balanced dataset of 10,134 molecules. This significantly outperforms standard random forest baselines (88%) and comparable single-target models in recent literature.
2.  **Rigorous Validation:** Unlike studies relying solely on random splits, we validated our model using **5-fold stratified cross-validation**, **McNemar’s statistical tests** (p < 0.001), and **Y-randomization** checks to ensure robustness.
3.  **Interpretability:** Addressing the "black box" limitation of deep learning, we successfully applied **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** analysis to uncover the specific chemical substructures driving predictions, bridging the gap between AI and medicinal chemistry. 
4.  **Open Science:** We have deployed the full model to the Hugging Face Hub and provided a reproducible codebase, aligning with JCIM’s commitment to transparent computational research.

Given JCIM’s focus on novel cheminformatics methodologies and their application to significant biological problems, we believe this work is highly relevant to your readership. This manuscript has not been published and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere. A preprint version has been uploaded to arXiv.

Thank you for your consideration.
