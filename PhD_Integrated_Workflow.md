*   **Status:** 🚧 **In Execution**.
*   **Focus:** **Application of the Pub 1 Model**.
*   **The Unique Angle ("The Synergistic Mystery"):**
    *   *Problem:* Pub 1 gives us a list of hits. But why is the *extract* often better than a single drug?
    *   *Solution:* **Network Pharmacology**. We map the "Poly-Pharmocology" of the extract.
*   **Workflow:**
    1.  **Wet Lab (Isolation):** Preparation of extracts -> Fractionation -> LC-MS/GC-MS Profiling.
    2.  **Data Bridge:** **Deriving SMILES** from the identified wet-lab isolates.
    3.  **Tier 2 AI Prediction (The Filter):** 
        *   Feed the *Wet Lab SMILES* into the **BioDockify Tier 2 Model**.
        *   **Outcome:** The AI predicts which specific isolates (e.g., Scopoletin, Caffeic Acid) are the active drivers of Alzheimer's inhibition.
    4.  **Systems Biology (The Novelty):** Construct a **Compound-Target-Pathway Network** (Cytoscape) to visualize Synergy.
    5.  **Wet Lab Validation:** In Vivo Scopolamine Model + Histopathology.
*   **Synthesis:** "Proving that the plant works via 'Synergistic Multi-Targeting', validated by AI and Animals."
        *   **Model:** Scopolamine-induced amnesia in mice/rats.
        *   **Behavioral:** Morris Water Maze (Memory), Y-Maze (Spatial), Novel Object Recognition.
        *   **Biochemical Profiling (Brain Homogenate):**
            *   *Enzymatic:* AChE and BuChE activity levels.
            *   *Oxidative Stress:* SOD, Catalase (CAT), Glutathione (GSH), Lipid Peroxidation (MDA).
            *   *Inflammation (ELISA):* TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β.
        *   **Histopathology:**
            *   H&E Staining (Neuronal damage in Hippocampus).
            *   Congo Red Staining (Amyloid differentiation - *optional*).
*   **Synthesis:** Correlation of Animal results (Observed effect) with AI Predictions (Predicted active compounds).
